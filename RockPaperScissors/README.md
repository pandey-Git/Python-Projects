## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

From there: 
* Store the user's input.
* Generate a random choice for the computer.
* Compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* Finally give feedback to the player. 

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)
